# Demo Docker Dev Environment
_Docker Dev Environment_ allows us to create a configurable developer environment with all the code and tools needed to quickly get up and running.

## How does it work?
>Dev Environments is powered by Docker Compose. This allows Dev Environments to take advantage of all the benefits and features of Compose whilst adding an intuitive GUI where you can launch environments with the click of a button.

>Every dev environment you want to run needs a compose-dev.yaml file which configures your application’s services and lives in your project directory. You don’t need to be an expert in Docker Compose or write a compose-dev.yaml file from scratch as Dev Environments creates a starter compose-dev.yaml files based on the main language in your project.
